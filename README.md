# Deep-Learning-Based-Image-Classifier

In this Project we will Build a Deep Learning Based Image Classifier with R. We are going to focus on two learning objectives:

1 - Solve a basic image classification problem with neural networks
2 - Use the Keras Interface to R to build a neural network

To chieve this, we will have used the R programming language to build, train, and evaluate a neural network model to classify images of clothing items into categories such as t-shirts, trousers, and sneakers.

The project is divided into the following tasks:

Task 1: Project Overview and Import Libraries

Task 2: Import the Fashion MNIST Dataset

Task 3: Data Exploration

Task 4: Preprocess the Data

Task 5: Build the Model

Task 6: Compile the Model

Task 7: Train and Evaluate the Model

Task 8: Make Predictions on Test Data
